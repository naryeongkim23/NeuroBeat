# NeuroBeat
The NeuroBeat project focuses on detecting concussions in athletes by analyzing changes in heart rate variability (HRV), a key indicator of autonomic nervous system balance. Concussions disrupt this balance, and NeuroBeat leverages these physiological shifts to provide a non-invasive, real-time tool for concussion detection and monitoring.
